        <h2>CSS/Design</h2>
        <p>This is what Front-end Development essentially entails. Known as client-side development, it deals with User Interactivity and is used to format and design the way users see the application content. This is the path to take if you are more inclined to align more with creativity, color, design, and imagination.</p>
        <h4>Advantages:</h4>
        <p>Maintaining an artist aspect by being responsible for implementing the look of the application into user friendly code, being able to think more of design as opposed to logic.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="well">
        <h2>Ruby/Rails</h2>
        <p>Ruby was designed to be easier for coders to write and understand and follows the belief that programming languages should be as similar to human language as possible. Ruby is object-oriented and makes it easy to transform an idea into a working application. It is used widely among web startups as well as big companies. In conjunction with its Rails framework, Ruby has become more versatile and easier to use when creating web applications. It is now one of the most in-demand languages and powers sites like Twitter and Hulu.</p>

        <h4>Advantages:</h4>
        <p>Gives web developers a framework and structure for their code, abstracts and simplifies common repetitive tasks, has a vast collection of open source code</p>
      </div>
      <div class="well">
        <h2>PHP/Drupal</h2>
        <p>An HTML embedded scripting language, PHP is one of most popular languages for web, and the first programming language designed for web use.  PHP comes preinstalled on most web servers. It runs big sites like Facebook and Etsy. Also, WordPress is written in PHP, and accounts for over 20% of all websites around the world.</p>
        <h4>Advantages:</h4>
        <p>Allows web developers to write dynamically generated pages quickly, cross-platform, speed, stable, open source and powerful library support</p>
      </div>
      <div class="well">
        <h2>Java/Android</h2>
        <p>Not related to JavaScript, Java was created for interactive TV. It is a good choice if youâ€™re leaning towards <strong>mobile development</strong>. Java is an object-oriented programming language, and can be used for anything from web application to desktop and mobile apps. It helps you build robust and scalable server-side applications. Java is often used to embed media or other content across different platforms. It has a strong presence among large enterprises (ie. banks).</p>
        <h4>Advantages:</h4>
        <p>Can run on all kinds of different software, allows programmers to move code to different platforms or operating systems without having to tweak or customize it. For example, building an app for a PC and moving it to a mobile device.</p>
        <p> Mantra: <em>"write once, run anywhere."</em></p>
      </div>
      <div class="well">
        <h2>C#/.NET</h2>
        <p>Developed by Microsoft, it is used to build a lot of Windows programs and is in all of their products. It is a good choice for web development on windows-based servers. C# can make for cleaner, faster development process in comparison with C or C++. However, it is a bit complicated and has a steeper learning curve.</p>
        <h4>Advantages:</h4>
        <p>Has stricter rules to help prevent programming mistakes, runs faster as a finished program, has features Java is missing.</p>
